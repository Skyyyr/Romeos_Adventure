# Romeo's Adventure

Romeo's Adventure description would go here. We should detail out things here..

## Project setup
* Clone the repo
* Set up your **venv** (Should look like this when done): `romeo\backend\venv`
  * If you want to test your Django project to ensure it was setup correctly, now would be a good time before continuing.
* Set up your npm modules (Should look like this when done): `romeo\frontend\node_modules`
  * Testing Vite project just like with Django can be done at this time
* Run the watch command, run the Django server, go to 127.0.0.1:8000 and see something like this...
